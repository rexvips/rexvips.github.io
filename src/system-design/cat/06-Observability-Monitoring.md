## Distributed Tracing

### Q1: Design a distributed tracing system for a microservices platform with 100+ services where individual requests may span 20+ services with complex async processing patterns.

**Summary**: Implement OpenTelemetry-based tracing with sampling strategies, span correlation across async boundaries, and performance-optimized collection to maintain visibility without overwhelming system performance.

**Deep Answer**:
Implement OpenTelemetry instrumentation across all services with consistent trace propagation using W3C Trace Context headers. Configure trace sampling using adaptive strategies: 100% sampling for errors and slow requests (>p95 latency), 1-10% sampling for normal requests based on service criticality and traffic volume.

Design span correlation for async processing using custom span links and baggage items. When processing moves to message queues or background jobs, inject parent trace context into message headers and restore context in consumers. Use span events to mark significant processing milestones within long-running operations.

Deploy distributed tracing backends using Jaeger or Zipkin with appropriate storage scaling: use Elasticsearch for trace storage with hot/warm/cold data lifecycle (7 days hot, 30 days warm, 90 days cold). Implement trace tail-based sampling to reduce storage costs while preserving interesting traces.

Implement performance optimization through batching, async export, and resource-efficient instrumentation. Configure SDK with batch processors, appropriate timeout values, and memory limits to prevent tracing overhead from impacting application performance (target <1% CPU overhead).

**Trade-offs**: Storage costs (TB-scale for high-traffic systems) vs debugging capability. Trace sampling rates vs complete request visibility. Instrumentation overhead vs observability depth.

**Functional Follow-up Questions**:
- How do you correlate traces across different async processing patterns (event queues, scheduled jobs, callbacks)?
- What's your strategy for tracing database queries and external API calls without exposing sensitive data?
- How do you implement trace sampling that captures both successful and failed request patterns?
- How do you handle trace context propagation in legacy systems without native OpenTelemetry support?

**Non-Functional Follow-up Questions**:
- How do you ensure distributed tracing doesn't violate data privacy regulations (PII in trace data)?
- What monitoring validates that tracing overhead stays within acceptable performance bounds?
- How do you manage tracing configuration changes across 100+ microservices?
- What's your strategy for tracing system reliability - ensuring observability tools don't become single points of failure?

**Interview Tip**: Emphasize understanding of sampling strategies and performance impact considerations at scale.

## Metrics Design & Collection

### Q2: Design a metrics collection strategy for a high-traffic API platform requiring real-time dashboards, capacity planning, and automated scaling decisions.

**Summary**: Implement hierarchical metrics collection using Prometheus with appropriate cardinality management, aggregation strategies, and multi-dimensional analysis to support operational decisions without overwhelming monitoring infrastructure.

**Deep Answer**:
Design metrics hierarchy using consistent naming conventions and label strategies: `http_requests_total{service="api-gateway", method="GET", status="200", endpoint="/orders"}`. Implement cardinality management by avoiding high-cardinality labels (user IDs, request IDs) and using bounded label values with "other" buckets for outliers.

Deploy multi-tier metrics collection: service-level metrics for detailed debugging, cluster-level metrics for capacity planning, and business-level metrics for KPI monitoring. Use recording rules for expensive queries and histogram aggregation to reduce query load on Prometheus.

Implement real-time streaming metrics using push gateways for short-lived jobs and pull-based collection for long-running services. Configure appropriate scrape intervals: 15s for critical services, 60s for standard services, 300s for batch jobs to balance freshness with collection overhead.

Design automated scaling integration by exposing metrics through custom metrics APIs for Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA). Use rate-based metrics (requests/second) and resource utilization (CPU, memory) to drive scaling decisions with appropriate smoothing and delay parameters.

**Trade-offs**: Metrics granularity vs storage requirements. Collection frequency vs system overhead. Real-time accuracy vs query performance optimization.

**Functional Follow-up Questions**:
- How do you handle metrics collection during service deployments and rollouts?
- What's your strategy for correlating business metrics with infrastructure metrics?
- How do you implement metrics federation across multiple data centers or regions?
- How do you design metrics for canary deployments and A/B testing scenarios?

## Alerting Rules & SLO Engineering

### Q3: Design an alerting strategy for a payment processing system with 99.99% availability SLO, integrating error budgets and multi-level escalation procedures.

**Summary**: Implement SLO-based alerting with error budget tracking, multi-window analysis, and intelligent escalation to balance alert fatigue with incident response while maintaining strict availability requirements.

**Deep Answer**:
Design SLO-based alerting using error budget consumption rates rather than absolute thresholds. For 99.99% availability (4.32 minutes monthly downtime), implement burn rate alerting: alert when error budget consumption exceeds 2x normal rate over multiple time windows (1h, 6h, 24h) to detect both fast and slow burns.

Implement multi-window alerting to reduce false positives: combine short window (5 minutes) for immediate issue detection with longer window (1 hour) for trend validation. Use composite conditions: `(error_rate_5m > 0.2%) AND (error_rate_1h > 0.1%)` to trigger actionable alerts.

Deploy intelligent escalation based on error budget remaining and impact severity. Immediate escalation for fast error budget burn (>50% in 1 hour), standard escalation for moderate burn (>25% in 6 hours), and proactive alerts for trend-based issues consuming >10% error budget in 24 hours.

Design context-rich alerts including runbook links, relevant dashboards, recent deployment history, and initial troubleshooting steps. Use alert grouping and dependency mapping to prevent alert storms during cascading failures and focus attention on root causes.

**Trade-offs**: Alert sensitivity vs false positive rates. Response time requirements vs escalation complexity. Error budget strictness vs operational flexibility during planned maintenance.

**Functional Follow-up Questions**:
- How do you handle SLO adjustments during planned maintenance windows or expected degraded performance?
- What's your strategy for alerting on user-facing vs internal service degradations?
- How do you implement alerting for complex user journeys spanning multiple services?
- How do you balance proactive alerting vs reactive incident response for different service tiers?

**Non-Functional Follow-up Questions**:
- How do you measure and optimize alert fatigue across different engineering teams?
- What strategies ensure alerting system reliability doesn't become a single point of failure?
- How do you validate that SLO definitions actually reflect user experience impacts?
- What's your approach for testing alerting rules without causing production noise?

**Interview Tip**: Demonstrate understanding of error budgets as a balancing mechanism between reliability and development velocity.

## Log Aggregation & Analysis

### Q4: Design a log aggregation system for a microservices platform generating 10TB of logs daily with requirements for real-time analysis, compliance retention, and cost optimization.

**Summary**: Implement tiered log processing with streaming analysis, intelligent routing, and lifecycle management to balance real-time insights, compliance requirements, and storage economics at petabyte scale.

**Deep Answer**:
Design tiered log processing using Kafka for real-time streaming, Elasticsearch for hot data (7 days), and object storage for cold data (7 years). Implement log routing based on criticality: error logs to real-time processing, audit logs to compliance storage, debug logs to sampling-based collection.

Deploy structured logging with consistent JSON schemas across all services including trace correlation IDs, service metadata, and standardized error formats. Use log sampling for high-volume debug logs (1-10% sampling) while maintaining 100% collection for errors and security events.

Implement real-time log analysis using stream processing (Kafka Streams, Flink) for immediate alerting on error patterns, security threats, and business anomalies. Use sliding window aggregations to detect error rate spikes, unusual access patterns, and performance degradations requiring immediate attention.

Design cost optimization through intelligent lifecycle management: compress logs using GZIP/LZ4, implement automatic archival policies, and use log parsing to extract metrics reducing raw log storage needs. Deploy log retention policies aligned with compliance requirements and business value.

**Trade-offs**: Storage costs (potentially $50K-100K/month) vs comprehensive logging. Real-time processing overhead vs insight timeliness. Log detail level vs storage economics.

**Functional Follow-up Questions**:
- How do you handle log correlation across services for complex request flows?
- What's your strategy for log format evolution without breaking analysis pipelines?
- How do you implement log redaction for PII and sensitive data compliance?
- How do you design log analysis for security incident investigation and forensics?

**Non-Functional Follow-up Questions**:

- What strategies prevent log analysis from impacting application performance?
- How do you validate log completeness and accuracy for compliance auditing?
- What's your approach for log system disaster recovery and cross-region replication?

**Interview Tip**: Show understanding of log economics and balancing comprehensive observability with cost management.

### Q5: Implement performance monitoring for a global CDN serving 1B requests/day with requirements for real-time performance tracking and automatic optimization decisions.

**Summary**: Deploy edge-based monitoring with synthetic testing, real user monitoring, and automated optimization feedback loops to maintain optimal performance across global infrastructure.

**Deep Answer**:
Implement multi-layer performance monitoring: synthetic monitoring from global test points for proactive issue detection, real user monitoring (RUM) for actual user experience measurement, and edge server metrics for infrastructure performance tracking.

Deploy edge-based metrics collection using lightweight agents at CDN points of presence (PoPs) reporting cache hit rates, origin server response times, bandwidth utilization, and request routing decisions. Use time-series databases (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) for high-cardinality performance data with appropriate retention policies.

Design automated optimization using performance feedback loops: adjust cache TTL based on hit rates, modify routing decisions based on latency measurements, and trigger origin server scaling based on cache miss patterns. Implement canary testing for optimization changes with automatic rollback on performance degradation.
