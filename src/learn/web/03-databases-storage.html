                            <p>Design separate OLTP and OLAP systems optimized for their specific workloads. Use row-oriented database (PostgreSQL, MySQL) for OLTP with normalized schemas optimizing for insert/update performance. Deploy column-oriented database (Clickhouse, Snowflake) for OLAP with denormalized star/snowflake schemas optimizing for aggregation queries.</p>

                            <p>Implement change data capture (CDC) using database logs (binlog, WAL) to stream changes from OLTP to OLAP systems with minimal performance impact. Use message queues (Kafka) for reliable delivery and buffering during maintenance windows. Transform data during ingestion to match analytical schema requirements.</p>

                            <p>For near real-time analytics, deploy hybrid approaches: maintain hot data in operational stores with limited analytical capabilities, while cold data resides in optimized analytical stores. Use materialized views for frequently accessed aggregations, refreshed via CDC triggers.</p>

                            <p>Calculate capacity requirements: 10K TPS with 2KB average transaction size requires 20MB/s write throughput. Plan for 10x peak capacity (100K TPS). OLAP storage grows with retention requirements: 1 year retention â‰ˆ 630TB raw data, requiring 3x storage for replication and compression considerations.</p>

                    <div class="question-content">
                        <div class="summary">
                            <strong>Summary:</strong> LSM-trees excel for write-heavy workloads with eventual consistency tolerance, B-trees provide consistent read performance, and in-memory engines offer lowest latency but require careful memory management and persistence strategies.
                        </div>

                            <h4>Deep Answer:</h4>
                            <p>B-tree engines (InnoDB, PostgreSQL) provide consistent O(log n) performance for both reads and writes with in-place updates. They suit workloads requiring consistent response times and strong consistency. Write amplification is higher due to page-level updates, but read performance remains predictable even during heavy write periods.</p>

                            <p>LSM-tree engines (RocksDB, Cassandra) optimize for write throughput using sequential writes to immutable sorted runs, periodically compacting to remove deleted entries and merge levels. Write amplification occurs during compaction, but initial writes are very fast. Read performance varies based on compaction state and requires bloom filters for efficient lookups.</p>

                            <p>In-memory engines (Redis, SAP HANA) eliminate disk I/O latency but require strategies for persistence and memory management. Use write-ahead logging for durability and snapshotting for recovery. Memory optimization techniques include compression, data structure selection, and garbage collection tuning.</p>

                            <p>For high-write mixed-read workloads, LSM-trees typically perform best due to superior write throughput. However, consider read amplification during compaction and implement appropriate caching strategies. Use tiered storage: hot data in memory, warm data in SSD-based LSM-trees, cold data in B-tree stores.</p>

                            <p>Design tenant-aware indexing starting with composite indexes (tenant_id, query_columns) to ensure efficient tenant isolation and query performance. For queries not filtering by tenant_id, create separate functional indexes but monitor for cross-tenant data leakage risks.</p>

                            <p>Implement tiered indexing based on tenant size: small tenants share standard indexes, while large tenants (>1M records) get dedicated partial indexes. Use conditional indexing: `CREATE INDEX idx_large_tenant_orders ON orders (order_date, status) WHERE tenant_id = 'large_tenant_123'` to optimize storage and maintenance overhead.</p>

                            <p>Deploy adaptive indexing using query pattern analysis: monitor slow query logs to identify missing indexes and automatically suggest/create indexes for frequently accessed patterns. Implement index usage monitoring to drop unused indexes that consume storage and slow down writes.</p>

                            <p>For complex analytical queries, implement covering indexes including all needed columns to avoid table lookups. Use expression indexes for computed columns frequently used in WHERE clauses. Consider columnstore indexes for analytical workloads on specific tenant segments.</p>

Assign logical timestamps to transactions and track read/write dependencies to detect serialization anomalies before commit.</p>

                            <p>Use predicate locking for range queries to prevent phantom reads while minimizing lock contention. Implement conflict detection through dependency graphs: if transaction T1 reads data that T2 modifies, and T2 commits first, abort T1 if it would violate serializable ordering.</p>

                            <p>Deploy strategic retry policies with exponential backoff and jitter to handle abort storms during high contention periods. For read-heavy workloads, use read-only transaction optimization where reads never abort and always see consistent snapshots.</p>

                            <p>For performance optimization in trading systems, implement transaction batching for related operations and use application-level conflict detection to pre-validate transactions before database submission. Deploy hot-cold data separation: frequently traded instruments use in-memory storage with different isolation strategies than historical data.</p>

                            <p>Start with execution plan analysis to identify bottlenecks: table scans, nested loop joins, and sort operations consuming excessive time. Create covering indexes for join columns and frequently filtered attributes. Use composite indexes matching query's WHERE and ORDER BY clauses.</p>

                            <p>Implement partition elimination by restructuring queries to include partition key filters. If querying time-series data, add date range filters matching partition boundaries. Use partition-wise joins when both tables are partitioned on join keys.</p>

                            <p>Optimize join order using cost-based optimization: join smaller result sets first, use hash joins for large tables, and nested loop joins for small lookups. Consider denormalization for frequently joined tables, trading storage for query performance.</p>

                            <p>Deploy parallel query execution with appropriate degree of parallelism (DOP). For 100M row tables, use DOP 4-8 depending on available CPU cores and I/O capacity. Monitor parallel execution efficiency and adjust based on resource utilization.</p>

                            <p>Implement dual-write migration pattern: initially sync historical data from MySQL to PostgreSQL using bulk data transfer tools. Then deploy application changes to write to both databases simultaneously while reading from MySQL. Use change data capture to ensure PostgreSQL stays synchronized with ongoing MySQL changes during the migration period.</p>

                            <p>Deploy gradual traffic shifting using feature flags and user segmentation. Start with 1% read traffic to PostgreSQL, gradually increasing to 50%, then 100% as confidence builds. Implement automated rollback triggers based on error rates, latency metrics, or data consistency checks. Maintain MySQL as authoritative source until full migration completion.</p>

                            <p>Design comprehensive data validation using checksums, row counts, and business logic validation queries running continuously during migration. Implement lag monitoring to ensure PostgreSQL stays within acceptable sync windows (typically <5 minutes). Use parallel data comparison tools to identify and resolve discrepancies quickly.</p>

                            <p>Handle schema differences using transformation layers: convert MySQL-specific data types, indexes, and constraints to PostgreSQL equivalents. Implement application compatibility layers for database-specific SQL features. Plan for performance testing with production-scale data to identify and resolve PostgreSQL optimization requirements before full cutover.</p>
