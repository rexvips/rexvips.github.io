                            <p>Implement OpenTelemetry instrumentation across all services with consistent trace propagation using W3C Trace Context headers. Configure trace sampling using adaptive strategies: 100% sampling for errors and slow requests (>p95 latency), 1-10% sampling for normal requests based on service criticality and traffic volume.</p>

                            <p>Design span correlation for async processing using custom span links and baggage items. When processing moves to message queues or background jobs, inject parent trace context into message headers and restore context in consumers. Use span events to mark significant processing milestones within long-running operations.</p>

                            <p>Deploy distributed tracing backends using Jaeger or Zipkin with appropriate storage scaling: use Elasticsearch for trace storage with hot/warm/cold data lifecycle (7 days hot, 30 days warm, 90 days cold). Implement trace tail-based sampling to reduce storage costs while preserving interesting traces.</p>

                            <p>Implement performance optimization through batching, async export, and resource-efficient instrumentation. Configure SDK with batch processors, appropriate timeout values, and memory limits to prevent tracing overhead from impacting application performance (target <1% CPU overhead).</p>

                            <p>Design SLO-based alerting using error budget consumption rates rather than absolute thresholds. For 99.99% availability (4.32 minutes monthly downtime), implement burn rate alerting: alert when error budget consumption exceeds 2x normal rate over multiple time windows (1h, 6h, 24h) to detect both fast and slow burns.</p>

                            <p>Implement multi-window alerting to reduce false positives: combine short window (5 minutes) for immediate issue detection with longer window (1 hour) for trend validation. Use composite conditions: <code>(error_rate_5m > 0.2%) AND (error_rate_1h > 0.1%)</code> to trigger actionable alerts.</p>

                            <p>Deploy intelligent escalation based on error budget remaining and impact severity. Immediate escalation for fast error budget burn (>50% in 1 hour), standard escalation for moderate burn (>25% in 6 hours), and proactive alerts for trend-based issues consuming >10% error budget in 24 hours.</p>

                            <p>Design context-rich alerts including runbook links, relevant dashboards, recent deployment history, and initial troubleshooting steps. Use alert grouping and dependency mapping to prevent alert storms during cascading failures and focus attention on root causes.</p>
