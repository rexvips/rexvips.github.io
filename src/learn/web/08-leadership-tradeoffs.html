                            <p>Apply CAP theorem analysis to social media use cases: timeline consistency can be eventually consistent (users tolerate slight delays), messaging requires stronger consistency (users expect immediate delivery confirmation), and user authentication needs strong consistency (security implications of inconsistency).</p>

                            <p>Design regional consistency strategies balancing user experience with technical complexity. Implement eventually consistent timeline aggregation with read-your-writes consistency for user posts, strong consistency for financial transactions (payments, ads), and tunable consistency for different feature categories based on business requirements.</p>

                            <p>Quantify business impact of consistency/availability trade-offs using A/B testing and user behavior analysis. Measure metrics: user engagement during network partitions, conversion rate impact from consistency delays, customer support ticket volume related to consistency issues, and revenue impact from availability degradation.</p>

                            <p>Implement adaptive consistency models where consistency guarantees adjust based on system load, network conditions, and business priority. Design fallback mechanisms: cached responses during partition scenarios, graceful degradation for non-critical features, and user communication strategies during consistency delays.</p>
