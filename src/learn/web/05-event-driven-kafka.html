                            <p>Design a 5-broker Kafka cluster across 3 availability zones (2-2-1 distribution) with replication factor 3 and min.insync.replicas=2 to ensure durability without single points of failure. For 1M transactions/day (~12 TPS average, ~120 TPS peak), configure appropriate partition counts based on consumer parallelism requirements and expected growth.</p>

                            <p>Configure producer settings for maximum durability: <code>acks=all</code>, <code>retries=Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>, <code>enable.idempotence=true</code> to prevent duplicate messages. Set <code>max.in.flight.requests.per.connection=1</code> to maintain strict ordering within partitions. Use synchronous sends for critical financial transactions despite performance impact.</p>

                            <p>Implement log segment configuration for compliance: <code>log.retention.hours=175200</code> (20 years), <code>log.segment.bytes=1GB</code>, <code>log.cleanup.policy=compact,delete</code> for audit trails. Configure <code>unclean.leader.election.enable=false</code> to prevent data loss during leader elections, accepting availability trade-offs for consistency.</p>

                            <p>Deploy comprehensive monitoring covering broker metrics (request rates, log lag, ISR shrinkage), producer metrics (batch sizes, compression ratios, retry counts), and cluster health (under-replicated partitions, offline partitions, controller election frequency).</p>

                            <p>Implement customer-based partitioning using customer_id as the partition key with murmur3 hash algorithm for even distribution. This ensures all events for a specific customer land in the same partition, maintaining per-customer ordering while enabling parallel processing across different customers.</p>

                            <p>Calculate partition count based on expected consumer parallelism and growth projections. For 100K active customers with average 5 orders/day, plan for 32-64 partitions supporting 32-64 concurrent consumers. Use consistent hashing to minimize rebalancing impact when adding partitions.</p>

                            <p>Handle related events (order created, payment processed, shipment initiated) by using composite keys: <code>customer_id#order_id</code> to maintain strict ordering within order lifecycle while distributing different orders across partitions. Implement partition affinity for session-based events using session_id prefixes.</p>

                            <p>Design consumer scaling strategies with partition assignment awareness: implement custom partition assignors for sticky assignment, use consumer group coordination for graceful rebalancing, and implement backpressure handling when consumers cannot keep up with production rates.</p>

                            <h4>Deep Answer:</h4>
                            <p>Implement exactly-once semantics using three complementary mechanisms: producer idempotency, consumer deduplication, and transactional processing. Producers include unique message IDs and use idempotent retry logic. Kafka's exactly-once semantics (EOS) provides producer-level guarantees through sequence numbers and producer epochs.</p>

                            <p>For consumers, implement deduplication using distributed cache (Redis) storing processed message IDs with appropriate TTL. Use consistent hashing to distribute deduplication state across cache nodes for scalability. For database operations, use upsert operations with business keys rather than generated IDs to ensure idempotency.</p>

                            <p>Deploy transactional outbox pattern: write business state changes and outgoing messages within the same database transaction, then asynchronously publish messages using change data capture. This ensures atomicity between state changes and message publishing, preventing dual-write problems.</p>

                            <p>For stream processing, use Kafka Streams' exactly-once processing with transaction boundaries spanning multiple topic partitions. Configure appropriate commit intervals balancing latency and duplicate processing risk during rebalancing.</p>

                            <p>Kafka Streams excels for complex business logic requiring custom processors, state store optimization, and fine-grained control over processing topology. It provides type safety, IDE support, and integration with existing Java ecosystems. Custom serializers, processors, and transformers enable optimization for specific use cases.</p>

                            <p>ksqlDB simplifies development for standard analytical operations using familiar SQL syntax. It provides built-in connectors, automatic scaling, and operational tooling. Push/pull queries enable both streaming and interactive analytics. Schema Registry integration provides automatic schema evolution and type safety.</p>

                            <p>For complex aggregations, Kafka Streams offers custom aggregation functions, multiple state stores, and optimization opportunities through processor API. ksqlDB provides standard SQL aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG) with windowing but limited customization for complex business logic.</p>

                            <p>Performance considerations: Kafka Streams allows fine-tuning through custom state stores, memory management, and processing optimization. ksqlDB abstracts these details but may have overhead for simple operations. Kafka Streams provides better control over resource utilization and scaling patterns.</p>

                            <p>Implement auto-scaling consumer groups based on consumer lag metrics. Monitor per-partition lag and trigger scaling when lag exceeds thresholds (e.g., >10,000 messages or >5 minutes behind). Use Kubernetes HPA with custom metrics or AWS Auto Scaling based on CloudWatch metrics to dynamically adjust consumer instance counts from 2 instances off-peak to 20 instances during peak hours.</p>

                            <p>Design partition assignment strategies using cooperative rebalancing (incremental cooperative rebalancing protocol) to minimize stop-the-world rebalancing. Configure <code>partition.assignment.strategy=CooperativeStickyAssignor</code> to maintain partition ownership during scaling events. Set appropriate <code>session.timeout.ms=30000</code> and <code>heartbeat.interval.ms=3000</code> to detect failed consumers quickly while avoiding false positives.</p>

Create multiple projections optimized for different query patterns: real-time balance views, historical reporting aggregations, and compliance audit trails. Use state stores with changelog topics for fault-tolerant projection recovery and implement projection versioning for schema evolution.</p>
