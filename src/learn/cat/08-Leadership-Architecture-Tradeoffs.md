## System Decomposition

### Q3: Design a strategy for decomposing a legacy monolithic system into microservices for a team that needs to maintain feature delivery velocity while reducing technical debt.

**Summary**: Apply domain-driven design principles with incremental extraction strategy, establish service boundaries using business capabilities, and implement migration patterns that minimize disruption to ongoing development work.

**Deep Answer**:
Apply domain-driven design (DDD) analysis to identify bounded contexts within the monolith. Conduct event storming sessions with domain experts to understand business workflows, identify aggregates, and define service boundaries aligned with business capabilities rather than technical concerns.

Design incremental extraction strategy using strangler fig pattern: implement new functionality as separate services while gradually extracting existing features. Start with leaf services having minimal dependencies, then move to core business services once extraction patterns are established.

Implement shared database decomposition using database-per-service pattern with careful transaction boundary analysis. Use saga patterns for distributed transactions, event sourcing for audit requirements, and API composition for cross-service queries. Plan for data consistency models appropriate for each business context.

Establish service interface contracts using API-first design with comprehensive testing strategies. Implement consumer-driven contract testing, service virtualization for development environments, and gradual rollout mechanisms with feature flags enabling safe service extraction.

**Trade-offs**: Development velocity during migration vs long-term architectural benefits. System complexity increase vs team autonomy gains. Data consistency guarantees vs service independence.

**Functional Follow-up Questions**:
- How do you handle service decomposition when business domain boundaries are unclear or disputed?
- What's your strategy for managing shared code and libraries across extracted services?

## Vendor & Technology Selection

### Q4: Lead technology selection for a critical payment processing system choosing between build vs buy vs partner options with strict performance, security, and compliance requirements.

**Summary**: Establish evaluation framework considering total cost of ownership, technical capabilities, compliance requirements, and strategic alignment while managing stakeholder expectations and risk mitigation strategies.

**Deep Answer**:
Establish comprehensive evaluation framework with weighted criteria: technical capabilities (performance, scalability, security), business alignment (cost, timeline, strategic fit), operational considerations (maintenance, support, integration complexity), and risk factors (vendor stability, lock-in, compliance).

Conduct detailed technical evaluation through proof-of-concept implementations testing performance under realistic load conditions, security assessment including penetration testing, and compliance validation against PCI DSS, SOX, and regional regulations. Compare build vs buy TCO over 3-5 year timeline including development, operational, and opportunity costs.

Design risk mitigation strategies for each option: build requires team expertise and maintenance commitment, buy introduces vendor dependency and integration complexity, partner involves revenue sharing and control limitations. Implement decision criteria including performance benchmarks, security requirements, and compliance certifications.

## Trade-off Analysis

### Q5: Analyze the trade-offs between consistency and availability for a global social media platform during a major architectural redesign affecting user experience and business metrics.

**Summary**: Apply CAP theorem principles with business context analysis, design multi-region consistency strategies, and implement measurement frameworks to optimize for user experience while maintaining system reliability.

**Deep Answer**:
Apply CAP theorem analysis to social media use cases: timeline consistency can be eventually consistent (users tolerate slight delays), messaging requires stronger consistency (users expect immediate delivery confirmation), and user authentication needs strong consistency (security implications of inconsistency).

Design regional consistency strategies balancing user experience with technical complexity. Implement eventually consistent timeline aggregation with read-your-writes consistency for user posts, strong consistency for financial transactions (payments, ads), and tunable consistency for different feature categories based on business requirements.

Quantify business impact of consistency/availability trade-offs using A/B testing and user behavior analysis. Measure metrics: user engagement during network partitions, conversion rate impact from consistency delays, customer support ticket volume related to consistency issues, and revenue impact from availability degradation.

Implement adaptive consistency models where consistency guarantees adjust based on system load, network conditions, and business priority. Design fallback mechanisms: cached responses during partition scenarios, graceful degradation for non-critical features, and user communication strategies during consistency delays.
